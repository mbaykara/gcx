## v0.2.14 (2026-05-08)

- **New**: Instrumentation Hub provider package with full CRUD, RMW, and
  Helm formatter support
- **New**: Alert provisioning CRUD — contact-points, mute-timings,
  notification-policies, and templates
- **New**: AI Observability saved-conversations and collections commands
- **New**: `gcx version` structured subcommand with machine-readable output
- **New**: `gcx assistant dashboard` subcommand; fix `--agent-id` flag
- **New**: Login accepts `--org-id` to configure organization ID
- Knowledge Graph entities list now supports pagination
- Knowledge Graph inspect drops hardcoded filters for raw, agent-friendly output
- Agents codec with temp-file spill for token-efficient agent output
- Log failed agent invocations to disk for capability-gap analysis
- Fix exit codes: usage errors emit 2, partial failures emit 4
- `stacks delete`: rename `--yes` to `--force`; respect agent mode
- Migrate all provider delete commands to consistent `ConfirmDestructive`
- Fix non-interactive confirmation bypass for metrics adaptive and alert
- Config check now classifies `.grafana.com` hosts and stack-id as Cloud

## v0.2.13 (2026-05-06)

**Note**: This release includes two important bugfixes 

- Fix `--dry-run` not being honored in resource delete operations. [PR #643](https://github.com/grafana/gcx/pull/643).
- Fix `--context` flag not applied across all CRUD adapter operations. [PR #625](https://github.com/grafana/gcx/pull/625).

Update to this version to avoid unintended operations on your Grafana Cloud stack.
